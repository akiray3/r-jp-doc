object from which to extract element(s) or in which to replace element(s).
indices specifying elements to extract or replace.  Indices arenumeric or character vectors or empty (missing) orNULL.  Numeric values are coerced to integer as byas.integer (and hence truncated towards zero).Character vectors will be matched to the names of theobject (or for matrices/arrays, the dimnames):see ‘Character indices’ below for further details.For [-indexing only: i, j, ... can belogical vectors, indicating elements/slices to select.  Such vectorsare recycled if necessary to match the corresponding extent.i, j, ... can also be negative integers,indicating elements/slices to leave out of the selection.When indexing arrays by [ a single argument i can be amatrix with as many columns as there are dimensions of x; theresult is then a vector with elements corresponding to the sets ofindices in each row of i.An index value of NULL is treated as if it were integer(0).

A literal character string or a name (possibly backtickquoted).
logical.  If TRUE the result is coerced to thelowest possible dimension.  The default is to drop if only onecolumn is left, but not to drop if only one row is left.
A suitable replacement value: it will be repeated a wholenumber of times if necessary and it may be coerced: see theCoercion section.  If NULL, deletes the column if a singlecolumn is selected.

either an optional character vector oflabels for the levels (in the same order as levels afterremoving those in exclude), or a character string oflength 1.  Duplicated values in labels can be used to mapdifferent values of x to the same factor level.
a vector of values to be excluded when forming theset of levels.  This may be factor with the same level set as xor should be a character.
logical flag to determine if the levels should be regardedas ordered (in the order given).

only add an NA level if it is used, i.e.if any(is.na(x)).
the function that is to be invoked each time a top-level taskis successfully completed.  This is called with 5 or 4 argumentsdepending on whether data is specified or not, respectively.The return value should be a logical value indicating whether tokeep the callback in the list of active callbacks or discard it.
if specified, this is the 5-th argument in the call to thecallback function f.

additional arguments affecting the summary produced.
an atomic numerical or character object, possiblycomplex only for prettyNum(), typically avector of real numbers.  Any class is discarded, with a warning.
the desired number of digits after the decimalpoint (format = "f") or significant digits(format = "g", = "e" or = "fg").Default: 2 for integer, 4 for real numbers.  If less than 0,the C default of 6 digits is used.  If specified as more than 50, 50will be used with a warning unless format = "f" where it islimited to typically 324. (Not more than 15–21 digits need beaccurate, depending on the OS and compiler used.  This limit isjust a precaution against segfaults in the underlying C runtime.)
the total field width; if both digits andwidth are unspecified, width defaults to 1,otherwise to digits + 1.  width = 0 will usewidth = digits, width < 0 means leftjustify the number in this field (equivalent to flag = "-").If necessary, the result will have more characters thanwidth.  For character data this is interpreted in characters(not bytes nor display width).
equal to "d"  (for integers), "f","e", "E", "g", "G", "fg" (forreals), or "s" (for strings).  Default is "d" forintegers, "g" for reals."f" gives numbers in the usualxxx.xxx format;  "e" and "E" give n.ddde+nn orn.dddE+nn (scientific format); "g" and "G" putx[i] into scientific format only if it saves space to do soand drop trailing zeros and decimal point - unless flagcontains "#" which keeps trailing zeros for the "g", "G"formats."fg" (our own hybrid format) uses fixed format as "f",but digits as the minimum number of significant digits.This can lead to quite long result strings, see examples below.  Notethat unlike signif this prints large numbers withmore significant digits than digits.  Trailing zeros aredropped in this format, unless flag contains"#".
for formatC, a character string giving aformat modifier as in Kernighan and Ritchie (1988, page 243) or theC+99 standard."0"pads leading zeros;"-"does left adjustment,"+"ensures a sign in all cases, i.e., "+" forpositive numbers ," "if the first character is not a sign, the spacecharacter " " will be used instead."#"specifies “an alternative output form”,specifically depending on format."'"on some platform–locale combination, activates“thousands' grouping” for decimal conversion,"I"in some versions of ‘glibc’ allow for integerconversion to use the locale's alternative output digits, if any.There can be more than one of these flags, in any order.  Other charactersused to have no effect for character formatting, but signalan error since R 3.4.0.

logical, character string or NULL specifyingif and how zeros should be formatted specially.  Useful forpretty printing ‘sparse’ objects.
logical; if zero.print is acharacter string, indicates if the exact zero entries in xshould be simply replaced by zero.print.  Otherwise,depending on the widths of the respective strings, the (formatted)zeroes are partly replaced by zero.print and thenpadded with " " to the right were applicable.  In that case(false replace[.zero]), if the zero.print string doesnot fit, a warning is produced (if warn.non.fitting is true).This works via prettyNum(), which calls .format.zeros(*,    replace=replace.zero) three times in this case, see the ‘Details’.
logical; if it is true, replace[.zero] isfalse and the zero.print string does not fit, awarning is signalled.
logical, indicating if trailing zeros,i.e., "0" after the decimal mark, should be removed;also drops "e+00" in exponential formats.  This is simply passedto prettyNum(), see the ‘Details’.
optional logical, to be used when x is"character" to indicate if it stems fromcomplex vector or not.  By default (NA),x is checked to ‘look like’ complex.

object from which to extract element(s) or in which to replace element(s).
indices specifying elements to extract or replace.  Indices arenumeric or character vectors or empty (missing) orNULL.  Numeric values are coerced to integer as byas.integer (and hence truncated towards zero).Character vectors will be matched to the names of theobject (or for matrices/arrays, the dimnames):see ‘Character indices’ below for further details.For [-indexing only: i, j, ... can belogical vectors, indicating elements/slices to select.  Such vectorsare recycled if necessary to match the corresponding extent.i, j, ... can also be negative integers,indicating elements/slices to leave out of the selection.When indexing arrays by [ a single argument i can be amatrix with as many columns as there are dimensions of x; theresult is then a vector with elements corresponding to the sets ofindices in each row of i.An index value of NULL is treated as if it were integer(0).
A literal character string or a name (possibly backtickquoted).  For extraction, this is normally (see under‘Environments’) partially matched to the namesof the object.
For matrices and arrays.  If TRUE the result iscoerced to the lowest possible dimension (see the examples).  Thisonly works for extracting elements, not for the replacement.  Seedrop for further details.
Controls possible partial matching of [[ whenextracting by a character vector (for most objects, but see under‘Environments’).  The default is no partial matching.  ValueNA allows partial matching but issues a warning when itoccurs.  Value FALSE allows partial matching without anywarning.

an atomic numerical or character object, possiblycomplex only for prettyNum(), typically avector of real numbers.  Any class is discarded, with a warning.
the desired number of digits after the decimalpoint (format = "f") or significant digits(format = "g", = "e" or = "fg").Default: 2 for integer, 4 for real numbers.  If less than 0,the C default of 6 digits is used.  If specified as more than 50, 50will be used with a warning unless format = "f" where it islimited to typically 324. (Not more than 15–21 digits need beaccurate, depending on the OS and compiler used.  This limit isjust a precaution against segfaults in the underlying C runtime.)
the total field width; if both digits andwidth are unspecified, width defaults to 1,otherwise to digits + 1.  width = 0 will usewidth = digits, width < 0 means leftjustify the number in this field (equivalent to flag = "-").If necessary, the result will have more characters thanwidth.  For character data this is interpreted in characters(not bytes nor display width).
equal to "d"  (for integers), "f","e", "E", "g", "G", "fg" (forreals), or "s" (for strings).  Default is "d" forintegers, "g" for reals."f" gives numbers in the usualxxx.xxx format;  "e" and "E" give n.ddde+nn orn.dddE+nn (scientific format); "g" and "G" putx[i] into scientific format only if it saves space to do soand drop trailing zeros and decimal point - unless flagcontains "#" which keeps trailing zeros for the "g", "G"formats."fg" (our own hybrid format) uses fixed format as "f",but digits as the minimum number of significant digits.This can lead to quite long result strings, see examples below.  Notethat unlike signif this prints large numbers withmore significant digits than digits.  Trailing zeros aredropped in this format, unless flag contains"#".
for formatC, a character string giving aformat modifier as in Kernighan and Ritchie (1988, page 243) or theC+99 standard."0"pads leading zeros;"-"does left adjustment,"+"ensures a sign in all cases, i.e., "+" forpositive numbers ," "if the first character is not a sign, the spacecharacter " " will be used instead."#"specifies “an alternative output form”,specifically depending on format."'"on some platform–locale combination, activates“thousands' grouping” for decimal conversion,"I"in some versions of ‘glibc’ allow for integerconversion to use the locale's alternative output digits, if any.There can be more than one of these flags, in any order.  Other charactersused to have no effect for character formatting, but signalan error since R 3.4.0.

string specifying if the string widths shouldbe preserved where possible in those cases where marks(big.mark or small.mark) are added.  "common",the default, corresponds to format-like behaviorwhereas "individual" is the default informatC(). Value can be abbreviated.
logical, character string or NULL specifyingif and how zeros should be formatted specially.  Useful forpretty printing ‘sparse’ objects.
logical; if zero.print is acharacter string, indicates if the exact zero entries in xshould be simply replaced by zero.print.  Otherwise,depending on the widths of the respective strings, the (formatted)zeroes are partly replaced by zero.print and thenpadded with " " to the right were applicable.  In that case(false replace[.zero]), if the zero.print string doesnot fit, a warning is produced (if warn.non.fitting is true).This works via prettyNum(), which calls .format.zeros(*,    replace=replace.zero) three times in this case, see the ‘Details’.
logical; if it is true, replace[.zero] isfalse and the zero.print string does not fit, awarning is signalled.
logical, indicating if trailing zeros,i.e., "0" after the decimal mark, should be removed;also drops "e+00" in exponential formats.  This is simply passedto prettyNum(), see the ‘Details’.
optional logical, to be used when x is"character" to indicate if it stems fromcomplex vector or not.  By default (NA),x is checked to ‘look like’ complex.

the name, possibly quote()d, of a functionto be traced or untraced.  For untrace or for tracewith more than one argument, more than one name can be given in thequoted form, and the same action will be applied to each one.  For“hidden” functions such as S3 methods in a namespace,where = * typically needs to be specified as well.
either a function or an unevaluated expression.  Thefunction will be called or the expression will be evaluated eitherat the beginning of the call, or before those steps in the callspecified by the argument at.See the details section.
either a function or an unevaluated expression.  Thefunction will be called or the expression will be evaluated onexiting the function.See the details section.
optional numeric vector or list.  If supplied, tracerwill be called just before the corresponding step in the body of thefunction.See the details section. 
If TRUE (as per default), a descriptive line isprinted before any trace expression is evaluated.
 If this argument is supplied, it should be asignature for a method for function what.  In this case, themethod, and not the function itself, is traced.
 For complicated tracing, such as tracing within a loopinside the function, you will need to insert the desired calls byediting the body of the function.  If so, supply the editargument either as TRUE, or as the name of the editor youwant to use.  Then trace() will call edit anduse the version of the function after you edit it.  See the detailssection for additional information.
where to look for the function to betraced; by default, the top-level environment of the call totrace.An important use of this argument is to trace functions from apackage which are “hidden” or called from another package.The namespace mechanism imports the functions to be called (with theexception of functions in the base package).  The functions beingcalled are not the same objects seen from the top-level (ingeneral, the imported packages may not even be attached).Therefore, you must ensure that the correct versions are beingtraced.  The way to do this is to set argument where to afunction in the namespace (or that namespace).  The tracingcomputations will then start looking in the environment of thatfunction (which will be the namespace of the corresponding package).(Yes, it's subtle, but the semantics here are central to hownamespaces work in R.)
logical; a call to the support function tracingState returns TRUEif tracing is globally turned on, FALSE otherwise.  Anargument of one or the other of those values sets the state.  If thetracing state is FALSE, none of the trace actions willactually occur (used, for example, by debugging functions to shutoff tracing during debugging).
arguments to the support function .doTrace, calls towhich are inserted into the modified function or method:expr is the tracing action (such as a call tobrowser()), and msg is a string identifying theplace where the trace action occurs.
If returnValue finds no return value (e.g.a function exited because of an error, restart or as a resultof evaluating a return from a caller function), it will returndefault instead.

either a logical value or a numeric-alike vector of lengthequal to the number of columns of x.
the name of a file to read data values from.  If thespecified file is "", then input is taken from the keyboard(or whatever stdin() reads if input is redirected orR is embedded).(In this case input can be terminated by a blank line or an EOFsignal, Ctrl-D on Unix and Ctrl-Z on Windows.)Otherwise, the file name is interpreted relative to thecurrent working directory (given by getwd()),unless it specifies an absolute path.Tilde-expansion is performed where supported.When running R from a script, file = "stdin" can be used torefer to the process's stdin file stream.This can be a compressed file (see file).Alternatively, file can be a connection,which will be opened if necessary, and if so closed at the end ofthe function call.  Whatever mode the connection is opened in,any of LF, CRLF or CR will be accepted as the EOL marker for a lineand so will match sep = "\n".file can also be a complete URL.  (For the supported URLschemes, see the ‘URLs’ section of the help forurl.)To read a data file not in the current encoding (for example aLatin-1 file in a UTF-8 locale or conversely) use afile connection setting its encoding argument(or scan's fileEncoding argument).
the type of what gives the type of data tobe read.  (Here ‘type’ is used in the sense oftypeof.)  The supported types are logical,integer, numeric, complex, character,raw and list.  If what is a list, it isassumed that the lines of the data file are records each containinglength(what) items (‘fields’) and the list componentsshould have elements which are one of the first six (atomic)types listed or NULL, see section ‘Details’ below.
the maximum number of data values to be read, or ifwhat is a list, the maximum number of records to be read.  Ifomitted or not positive or an invalid value for an integer(and nlines is not set to a positive value), scan willread to the end of file.
integer: the maximum number of data values to be read, defaulting tono limit.  Invalid values will be ignored.
by default, scan expects to read ‘white-space’delimited input fields.  Alternatively, sep can be used tospecify a character which delimits fields.  A field is alwaysdelimited by an end-of-line marker unless it is quoted.If specified this should be the empty character string (the default)or NULL or a character string containing just one single-bytecharacter.
the set of quoting characters as a single characterstring or NULL.  In a multibyte locale the quoting charactersmust be ASCII (single-byte).
decimal point character.  This should be a character stringcontaining just one single-byte character.  (NULL and azero-length character vector are also accepted, and taken as thedefault.)
the number of  lines of the input file to skip beforebeginning to read data values.
if positive, the maximum number of lines of data to be read.
character vector.  Elements of this vector are to beinterpreted as missing (NA) values.  Blank fields arealso considered to be missing values in logical, integer, numericand complex fields.  Note that the test happens after white space is stripped from the input, so na.strings values may need their own white space stripped in advance.
logical: if TRUE, scan will flush to theend of the line after reading the last of the fields requested.This allows putting comments after the last field, but precludesputting more that one record on a line.
logical: if TRUE, scan will implicitly addempty fields to any lines with fewer fields than implied bywhat.
vector of logical value(s) corresponding to itemsin the what argument.  It is used only when sep hasbeen specified, and allows the stripping of leading and trailing‘white space’ from character fields (numeric fieldsare always stripped).  Note: white space inside quoted strings isnot stripped.If strip.white is of length 1, it applies to all fields;otherwise, if strip.white[i] is TRUE and thei-th field is of mode character (because what[i] is)then the leading and trailing unquoted white space from field i isstripped.
logical: if FALSE (default), scan() will print aline, saying how many items have been read.
logical: if TRUE blank lines in theinput are ignored, except when counting skip and nlines.
logical.  Only used if what is a list.  IfFALSE, all of a record must appear on one line (but more thanone record can appear on a single line).  Note that using fill = TRUEimplies that a record will be terminated at the end of a line.
character: a character vector of length onecontaining a single character or an empty string.  Use "" toturn off the interpretation of comments altogether (the default).
logical.  Should C-style escapes such as\n be processed (the default) or read verbatim?   Note that ifnot within quotes these could be interpreted as a delimiter (but notas a comment character).The escapes which are interpreted are the control characters\a, \b, \f, \n, \r, \t, \v and octal andhexadecimal representations like \040 and \0x2A.  Anyother escaped character is treated as itself, including backslash.Note that Unicode escapes (starting \u or \U: seeQuotes) are never processed.
character string: if non-empty declares theencoding used on a file (not a connection nor the keyboard) so thecharacter data can be re-encoded.  See the ‘Encoding’ sectionof the help for file, and the ‘R DataImport/Export Manual’.
encoding to be assumed for input strings.  If thevalue is "latin1" or "UTF-8" it is used to markcharacter strings as known to be in Latin-1 or UTF-8: it is not usedto re-encode the input (see fileEncoding).See also ‘Details’.
character string: if file is not supplied and this is,then data are read from the value of text via a text connection.
logical: should nuls be skipped when reading characterfields?

 For complicated tracing, such as tracing within a loopinside the function, you will need to insert the desired calls byediting the body of the function.  If so, supply the editargument either as TRUE, or as the name of the editor youwant to use.  Then trace() will call edit anduse the version of the function after you edit it.

The functions beingcalled are not the same objects seen from the top-level (ingeneral, the imported packages may not even be attached).Therefore, you must ensure that the correct versions are beingtraced.  The way to do this is to set argument where to afunction in the namespace (or that namespace).

An expression in a formal sense.  This is either asimple expression or a so-called compound expression, usuallyof the form { expr1 ; expr2 }.
data to use for constructing an environment. For thedefault with method this may be an environment, a list, adata frame, or an integer as in sys.call. For within,it can be a list or a data frame.
expression to evaluate; particularly for within()often a “compound” expression, i.e., of the form    {     a <- somefun()     b <- otherfun()     .....     rm(unused1, temp)   }
for the list method of within(),a logical specifying if the resulting list should keepthe attributes from data and have itsnames in the same order.  Often this is unneeded asthe result is a named list anyway, and then keepAttrs =      FALSE is more efficient.
arguments to be passed to (future) methods.

arguments to be passed to (future) methods.
a connection or a character string giving thepathname of the file or URL to read from.  "" indicates theconnection stdin().
TRUE, FALSE or an environment, determiningwhere the parsed expressions are evaluated.  FALSE (thedefault) corresponds to the user's workspace (the globalenvironment) and TRUE to the environment from whichsource is called.
logical; if TRUE, each expression is printedafter parsing, before evaluation.
logical; if TRUE, the result ofeval(i) is printed for each expression i; defaultsto the value of echo.
for source() and withAutoprint(*, evaluated=TRUE):instead of specifying file, anexpression, call, or listof call's, but not an unevaluated “expression”.for withAutoprint() (with default evaluated=FALSE):one or more unevaluated “expressions”.
logical indicating that exprs is passed tosource(exprs= *) and hence must be evaluated, i.e., a formalexpression, call or list of calls.
logical indicating if newline (hence empty line) shouldbe printed before each expression (when echo = TRUE).
if TRUE, more diagnostics (than justecho = TRUE) are printed during parsing and evaluation ofinput, including extra info for each expression.
character; gives the prompt to be used ifecho = TRUE.
integer; is used only if echo isTRUE and gives the maximal number of characters output forthe deparse of a single expression.
integer, passed to deparse() whichis used (only) when there are no source references.
character vector, passed ascontrol to deparse(), see also.deparseOpts.  In R version <= 3.3.x, this washardcoded to "showAttributes", which is the defaultcurrently; deparseCtrl = "all" may be preferable, when strictback compatibility is not of importance.
logical; if TRUE and file is a pathname,the R working directory is temporarily changed to the directorycontaining file for evaluating.
character vector.  The encoding(s) to be assumed whenfile is a character string: see file.  Apossible value is "unknown" when the encoding is guessed: seethe ‘Encodings’ section.
character; gives the prompt to use oncontinuation lines if echo = TRUE.
integer; how many comment lines at the start of thefile to skip if echo = TRUE.
logical: should the source formatting be retainedwhen echoing expressions, if possible?

the points at which tick-marks are to be drawn.  Non-finite(infinite, NaN or NA) values are omitted.  By default(when NULL) tickmark locations are computed, see‘Details’ below.
this can either be a logical value specifying whether(numerical) annotations are to be made at the tickmarks, or acharacter or expression vector of labels to be placed at thetickpoints.  (Other objects are coerced by as.graphicsAnnot.)If this is not logical, at should also be supplied and of thesame length.  If labels is of length zero after coercion,it has the same effect as supplying TRUE.

the number of lines into the margin at which the axis linewill be drawn, if not NA.
the coordinate at which the axis line is to be drawn:if not NA this overrides the value of line.

adjustment (see par("adj")) for all labelsparallel (‘horizontal’) to the reading direction.  Ifthis is not a finite value, the default is used (centring forstrings parallel to the axis, justification of the end nearest theaxis otherwise).
adjustment for each tick label perpendicular to thereading direction.  For labels parallel to the axes, padj = 0means right or top alignment, and padj = 1 means left or bottomalignment.  This can be a vector given a value for each string, andwill be recycled as necessary.If padj is not a finite value (the default), the value ofpar("las") determines the adjustment.  For strings plottedperpendicular to the axis the default is to centre the string.
an optional (typically non-negative) numeric factor tobe multiplied with the size of an ‘m’ to determine theminimal gap between labels that are drawn, see ‘Details’.The default, NA, corresponds to 1 for tick labels drawnparallel to the axis and 0.25 otherwise, i.e., thedefault is equivalent to   perpendicular <- function(side, las) {    is.x <- (side %% 2 == 1) # is horizontal x-axis    ( is.x && (las %in% 2:3)) ||    (!is.x && (las %in% 1:2))  }  gap.axis <- if(perpendicular(side, las)) 0.25 else 1gap.axis may typically be relevant when at = ..tick-mark positions are specified explicitly.
other graphical parameters may also be passed asarguments to this function, particularly, cex.axis, col.axisand font.axis for axis annotation, i.e. tick labels, mgpand xaxp or yaxp for positioning, tck ortcl for tick mark length and direction, las forvertical/horizontal label orientation, or fg instead ofcol, and xpd for clipping.  See par on these.Parameters xaxt (sides 1 and 3) and yaxt (sides 2 and4) control if the axis is plotted at all.Note that lab will partial match to argumentlabels unless the latter is also supplied.  (Since thedefault axes have already been set up by plot.window,lab will not be acted on by axis.)
an object which indicates the range over which an axis shouldbe drawn
the points at which tick-marks are to be drawn.
an integer specifying which side of the plot the axis isto be drawn on.  The axis is placed as follows: 1=below,2=left, 3=above and 4=right.
this can either be a logical value specifying whether(numerical) annotations are to be made at the tickmarks, or acharacter or expression vector of labels to be placed at thetickpoints. If this is specified as a character or expressionvector, at should be supplied and they should be the samelength.

Factors from 1 to nfactors will be extracted. If nfactors is a a vector, then just the number of factors specified in the vector will be extracted. (See examples).
Factor method.  The default is 'minres' factoring.  Although to be consistent with the original Goldberg article, we can also do principal components (fm ="pca").
What type of rotation to apply.  The default for factors is oblimin.  Unlike the normal call to pca where the default is varimax, in bassAckward the default for pca is oblimin.
What factor scoring algorithm should be used. The default is "tenBerge", other possibilities include "regression", or "bartlett"
If using any other scoring proceure that "tenBerge" should we adjust the correlations for the lack of factor score fit?

The input may be in one of four forms:a) a data frame or matrix of dichotmous data (e.g., the lsat6 from the bock data set) or discrete numerical (i.e., not too many levels, e.g., the big 5 data set, bfi) for polychoric, or continuous for the case of biserial and polyserial. b) a 2 x 2 table of cell counts or cell frequencies (for tetrachoric) or an n x m table of cell counts  (for both tetrachoric and polychoric). c) a vector with elements corresponding to the four cell frequencies (for tetrachoric)d) a vector with elements of the two marginal frequencies (row and column) and the comorbidity (for tetrachoric)
A (matrix or dataframe) of discrete scores. In the case of tetrachoric, these should be dichotomous, for polychoric not too many levels, for biserial they should be discrete (e.g., item responses) with not too many (<10?) categories.
Correction value to use to correct for continuity in the case of zero entry cell for tetrachoric, polychoric, polybi, and mixed.cor.  See the examples for the effect of correcting versus not correcting for continuity.
if TRUE and if the tetrachoric/polychoric matrix is not positive definite, then apply a simple smoothing algorithm using cor.smooth
When finding pairwise correlations, should we use the global values of the tau parameter (which is somewhat faster), or the local values (global=FALSE)?  The local option is equivalent to the polycor solution, or to doing one correlation at a time. global=TRUE borrows information for one item pair from the other pairs using those item's frequencies.   This will make a difference in the presence of lots of missing data. With very small sample sizes with global=FALSE and correct=TRUE, the function will fail (for as yet underdetermined reasons. 
A no longer used option, kept to stop other packages from breaking.

 other parameters 
A correlation or covariance matrix or a raw data matrix. If raw data, the correlation matrix will be found using pairwise deletion. If covariances are supplied, they will be converted to correlations unless the covar option is TRUE.
 Number of factors to extract, default is 1 
Number of observations used to find the correlation matrix if using a correlation matrix.  Used for finding the goodness of fit statistics. Must be specified if using a correlaton matrix and finding confidence intervals.
The pairwise number of observations. Used if using a correlation matrix and asking for a minchi solution.
"none", "varimax", "quartimax",  "bentlerT", "equamax", "varimin", "geominT" and "bifactor" are orthogonal rotations.  "Promax", "promax", "oblimin", "simplimax", "bentlerQ,  "geominQ" and "biquartimin" and "cluster" are possible oblique transformations of the solution.  The default is to do a oblimin transformation, although  versions prior to 2009 defaulted to varimax. SPSS seems to do a Kaiser normalization before doing Promax, this is done here by the call to "promax" which does the normalization before calling Promax in GPArotation.
Number of random starts for the rotations.
Number of bootstrap interations to do in fa or fa.poly
Should the residual matrix be shown 
the default="regression" finds factor scores using regression.  Alternatives for  estimating factor scores include simple regression ("Thurstone"), correlaton preserving ("tenBerge") as well as "Anderson" and "Bartlett" using the appropriate algorithms ( factor.scores). Although scores="tenBerge" is probably preferred for most solutions, it will lead to problems with some improper correlation matrices.  
Use squared multiple correlations (SMC=TRUE) or use 1  as initial communality estimate. Try using 1 if imaginary eigen values are reported. If SMC is a vector of length the number of variables, then these values are used as starting values in the case of fm='pa'. 
if covar is TRUE, factor the covariance matrix, otherwise factor the correlation matrix
if scores are TRUE, and missing=TRUE, then impute missing values using either the median or the mean
"median" or "mean" values are used to replace missing values
Iterate until the change in communalities is less than min.err
Maximum number of iterations for convergence 
symmetric=TRUE forces symmetry by just looking at the lower off diagonal values
Count number of (absolute) loadings less than hyper. 
warnings=TRUE => warn if number of factors is too many 
Factoring method  fm="minres" will do a minimum residual as will fm="uls".  Both of these use a first derivative.  fm="ols" differs very slightly from "minres" in that it minimizes the entire residual matrix using an OLS procedure but uses the empirical first derivative.  This will be slower.  fm="wls" will do a weighted least squares (WLS) solution, fm="gls" does a generalized weighted least squares (GLS), fm="pa" will do the principal factor solution, fm="ml" will do a maximum likelihood factor analysis. fm="minchi" will minimize the sample size weighted chi square when treating pairwise correlations with different number of subjects per pair. fm ="minrank" will do a minimum rank factor analysis. "old.min" will do minimal residual the way it was done prior to April, 2017 (see discussion below).  fm="alpha" will do alpha factor analysis as described in Kaiser and Coffey (1965)
alpha level for the confidence intervals for RMSEA
if doing iterations to find confidence intervals, what probability values should be found for the confidence intervals
When factor scores are found, should they be based on the structure matrix (default) or the pattern matrix (oblique.scores=TRUE).  Now it is always false.  If you want oblique factor scores, use tenBerge.  
If not NULL, a vector of length n.obs that contains weights for each observation. The NULL case is equivalent to all cases being weighted 1.
How to treat missing data, use="pairwise" is the default".  See cor for other options.
How to find the correlations: "cor" is Pearson", "cov" is covariance, "tet" is tetrachoric, "poly" is polychoric, "mixed" uses mixed cor for a mixture of tetrachorics, polychorics, Pearsons, biserials, and polyserials, Yuleb is Yulebonett, Yuleq and YuleY are the obvious Yule coefficients as appropriate
When doing tetrachoric, polycoric, or mixed cor, how should we treat empty cells.  (See the discussion in the help for tetrachoric.)

This matches the call to fa
For tetrachoric correlations, should a correction for continuity be applied. (See tetrachoric)  If set to 0, then no correction is applied, otherwise, the default is to add .5 observations to the cell.
For continuous data, the default is to resample as well as to generate random normal data.  If sim=FALSE, then just show the resampled results. These two results are very similar. This does not make sense in the case of  correlation matrix, in which case resampling is impossible. In the case of polychoric or tetrachoric data, in addition to randomizing the real data, should we compare the solution to random simulated data.  This will double the processing time, but will basically show the same result.
Should error.bars be plotted (default = FALSE)
Should the error bars be standard errors (se.bars=TRUE) or 1 standard deviation (se.bars=FALSE, the default).  With many iterations, the standard errors are very small and some prefer to see the broader range.  The default has been changed in 1.7.8 to be se.bars=FALSE to more properly show the range.
SMC=TRUE finds eigen values after estimating communalities by using SMCs.  smc = FALSE finds eigen values after estimating communalities with the first factor.
