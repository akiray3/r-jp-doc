"Promax", "promax", "oblimin", "simplimax", "bentlerQ,  "geominQ" and "biquartimin" and "cluster" are possible oblique transformations of the solution.  The default is to do a oblimin transformation, although  versions prior to 2009 defaulted to varimax. SPSS seems to do a Kaiser normalization before doing Promax, this is done here by the call to "promax" which does the normalization before calling Promax in GPArotation.
Number of random starts for the rotations.

the default="regression" finds factor scores using regression.  Alternatives for  estimating factor scores include simple regression ("Thurstone"), correlaton preserving ("tenBerge") as well as "Anderson" and "Bartlett" using the appropriate algorithms ( <code>factor.scores</code>). Although scores="tenBerge" is probably preferred for most solutions, it will lead to problems with some improper correlation matrices.  
Use squared multiple correlations (SMC=TRUE) or use 1  as initial communality estimate. Try using 1 if imaginary eigen values are reported. If SMC is a vector of length the number of variables, then these values are used as starting values in the case of fm='pa'. 
if covar is TRUE, factor the covariance matrix, otherwise factor the correlation matrix

"median" or "mean" values are used to replace missing values

Factoring method  fm="minres" will do a minimum residual as will fm="uls".  Both of these use a first derivative.  fm="ols" differs very slightly from "minres" in that it minimizes the entire residual matrix using an OLS procedure but uses the empirical first derivative.  This will be slower.  fm="wls" will do a weighted least squares (WLS) solution, fm="gls" does a generalized weighted least squares (GLS), fm="pa" will do the principal factor solution, fm="ml" will do a maximum likelihood factor analysis. fm="minchi" will minimize the sample size weighted chi square when treating pairwise correlations with different number of subjects per pair. fm ="minrank" will do a minimum rank factor analysis. "old.min" will do minimal residual the way it was done prior to April, 2017 (see discussion below).  fm="alpha" will do alpha factor analysis as described in Kaiser and Coffey (1965)

When factor scores are found, should they be based on the structure matrix (default) or the pattern matrix (oblique.scores=TRUE).  Now it is always false.  If you want oblique factor scores, use tenBerge.  
If not NULL, a vector of length n.obs that contains weights for each observation. The NULL case is equivalent to all cases being weighted 1.
How to treat missing data, use="pairwise" is the default".  See cor for other options.
How to find the correlations: "cor" is Pearson", "cov" is covariance, "tet" is tetrachoric, "poly" is polychoric, "mixed" uses mixed cor for a mixture of tetrachorics, polychorics, Pearsons, biserials, and polyserials, Yuleb is Yulebonett, Yuleq and YuleY are the obvious Yule coefficients as appropriate

For tetrachoric correlations, should a correction for continuity be applied. (See tetrachoric)  If set to 0, then no correction is applied, otherwise, the default is to add .5 observations to the cell.
For continuous data, the default is to resample as well as to generate random normal data.  If sim=FALSE, then just show the resampled results. These two results are very similar. This does not make sense in the case of  correlation matrix, in which case resampling is impossible.

This will double the processing time, but will basically show the same result.

If TRUE, automatically call the <code>plot.irt</code> or <code>plot.poly</code> functions.
the subset of variables to pick from the rho and tau output of a previous irt.fa analysis to allow for further analysis.

The default rotation is oblimin.  See <code>fa</code> for the other options.
The default factor extraction is minres.  See <code>fa</code> for the other options.
The object returned from <code>fa</code> 
The object returned from <code>polychoric</code> or <code>tetrachoric</code>.  This will include both a correlation matrix and the item difficulty levels.
Should the factor loadings be sorted before preparing the item information tables.  Defaults to FALSE as this is more useful for scoring items. For tabular output it is better to have sort=TRUE.
Additional parameters to pass to the factor analysis function
A matrix or dataframe with rows for subjects, columns for variables.  One of these columns should be the values of a grouping variable.
The names or numbers of the variable in data to use as the grouping variables.
Should the results include the correlation matrix within each group?  Default is FALSE.
Type of correlation/covariance to find within groups and between groups.  The default is Pearson correlation.  To find within and between covariances, set cor="cov".  Although polychoric, tetrachoric, and mixed correlations can be found within groups, this does not make sense for the between groups or the pooled within groups.  In this case, correlations for each group will be as specified, but the between groups and pooled within will be Pearson. See the discussion below.

 Number of factors to extract, default is 1 
Number of observations used to find the correlation matrix if using a correlation matrix.  Used for finding the goodness of fit statistics. Must be specified if using a correlaton matrix and finding confidence intervals.
The pairwise number of observations. Used if using a correlation matrix and asking for a minchi solution.
"none", "varimax", "quartimax",  "bentlerT", "equamax", "varimin", "geominT" and "bifactor" are orthogonal rotations.  "Promax", "promax", "oblimin", "simplimax", "bentlerQ,  "geominQ" and "biquartimin" and "cluster" are possible oblique transformations of the solution.  The default is to do a oblimin transformation, although  versions prior to 2009 defaulted to varimax. SPSS seems to do a Kaiser normalization before doing Promax, this is done here by the call to "promax" which does the normalization before calling Promax in GPArotation.
Number of random starts for the rotations.
Number of bootstrap interations to do in fa or fa.poly
Should the residual matrix be shown 
the default="regression" finds factor scores using regression.  Alternatives for  estimating factor scores include simple regression ("Thurstone"), correlaton preserving ("tenBerge") as well as "Anderson" and "Bartlett" using the appropriate algorithms ( <code>factor.scores</code>). Although scores="tenBerge" is probably preferred for most solutions, it will lead to problems with some improper correlation matrices.  
Use squared multiple correlations (SMC=TRUE) or use 1  as initial communality estimate. Try using 1 if imaginary eigen values are reported. If SMC is a vector of length the number of variables, then these values are used as starting values in the case of fm='pa'. 
if covar is TRUE, factor the covariance matrix, otherwise factor the correlation matrix
if scores are TRUE, and missing=TRUE, then impute missing values using either the median or the mean
"median" or "mean" values are used to replace missing values
Iterate until the change in communalities is less than min.err
Maximum number of iterations for convergence 
symmetric=TRUE forces symmetry by just looking at the lower off diagonal values
Count number of (absolute) loadings less than hyper. 
warnings=TRUE =&gt; warn if number of factors is too many 
Factoring method  fm="minres" will do a minimum residual as will fm="uls".  Both of these use a first derivative.  fm="ols" differs very slightly from "minres" in that it minimizes the entire residual matrix using an OLS procedure but uses the empirical first derivative.  This will be slower.  fm="wls" will do a weighted least squares (WLS) solution, fm="gls" does a generalized weighted least squares (GLS), fm="pa" will do the principal factor solution, fm="ml" will do a maximum likelihood factor analysis. fm="minchi" will minimize the sample size weighted chi square when treating pairwise correlations with different number of subjects per pair. fm ="minrank" will do a minimum rank factor analysis. "old.min" will do minimal residual the way it was done prior to April, 2017 (see discussion below).  fm="alpha" will do alpha factor analysis as described in Kaiser and Coffey (1965)
alpha level for the confidence intervals for RMSEA
if doing iterations to find confidence intervals, what probability values should be found for the confidence intervals
When factor scores are found, should they be based on the structure matrix (default) or the pattern matrix (oblique.scores=TRUE).  Now it is always false.  If you want oblique factor scores, use tenBerge.  
If not NULL, a vector of length n.obs that contains weights for each observation. The NULL case is equivalent to all cases being weighted 1.
How to treat missing data, use="pairwise" is the default".  See cor for other options.
How to find the correlations: "cor" is Pearson", "cov" is covariance, "tet" is tetrachoric, "poly" is polychoric, "mixed" uses mixed cor for a mixture of tetrachorics, polychorics, Pearsons, biserials, and polyserials, Yuleb is Yulebonett, Yuleq and YuleY are the obvious Yule coefficients as appropriate

Should cases be weighted?  Default, no.

If doing target rotations (e.g., TargetQ or TargetT), then the Target must be specified.  If TargetT, this may be a matrix, if TargetQ, this must be a list.  (Strange property of GPARotation.)
 A matrix of factor loadings or a list of matrices of factor loadings
 A second matrix of factor loadings (if x is a list, then y may be empty)
Round off to digits

If TRUE, report alphas for every subject (default)
If TRUE, find ICCs for each person – can take a while
if FALSE, and if icc  is FALSE, then just draw the within subject plots
Should we use the lme4 package and lmer or just do the ANOVA?  Requires thelme4 package to be installed.  Necessary to do crossed designs with missing data but takes a very long time.

This matches the call to fa
For tetrachoric correlations, should a correction for continuity be applied. (See tetrachoric)  If set to 0, then no correction is applied, otherwise, the default is to add .5 observations to the cell.
For continuous data, the default is to resample as well as to generate random normal data.  If sim=FALSE, then just show the resampled results. These two results are very similar. This does not make sense in the case of  correlation matrix, in which case resampling is impossible. In the case of polychoric or tetrachoric data, in addition to randomizing the real data, should we compare the solution to random simulated data.  This will double the processing time, but will basically show the same result.
Should error.bars be plotted (default = FALSE)
Should the error bars be standard errors (se.bars=TRUE) or 1 standard deviation (se.bars=FALSE, the default).  With many iterations, the standard errors are very small and some prefer to see the broader range.  The default has been changed in 1.7.8 to be se.bars=FALSE to more properly show the range.
SMC=TRUE finds eigen values after estimating communalities by using SMCs.  smc = FALSE finds eigen values after estimating communalities with the first factor.
Label for the y axis – defaults to “eigen values of factors and components", can be made empty to show many graphs
the default is to have a legend.  For multiple panel graphs, it is better to not show the legend

If a value (e.g., quant=.95) is specified, then the eigen values are compared against the matching quantile of the simulated data.  Clearly the larger the value of quant, the few factors/components that will be identified.

A list of items to be scored (may be taken from a keys.list for <code>scoreItems</code>. This list may contain one or more keys. ) If keys are not specified, then all the items are used.
The matrix or data.frame of items to be scored.  Can be substantially greater than the items included in keys. For just those items in each key are scored.
Omega is not well defined for two factors, but for small sets of items, two is the better choice. For larger number of items per scale, 3 is probably preferable.
By default, find splitHalf reliabilities as well as the omega statistics. When plotting, split implies that raw was called in reliability.
By default, suppress the omega plots for each scale.
If TRUE, return a list of all the possible splits (up to n.samples).  Useful for graphic display. 
If TRUE then  split and raw are forced to TRUE and the histograms of the split half values are drawn.  (Otherwise, just return the values for later plotting)
Normally defaults to 10,000.  This means that for up to 16 item tests, all possible splits are found.  choose(n,n/2)/2 explodes above that, eg. for all splits of the epi E scale requires 1,352,078 splits or 23.4 seconds on a MacBook Pro with a 2.4GHZ 8 core Intel Core I9.  Can be done, but do you want to do so?

A list of items to be scored (may be taken from a keys.list for <code>scoreItems</code>. This list may contain one or more keys. ) If keys are not specified, then all the items are used.
The matrix or data.frame of items to be scored.  Can be substantially greater than the items included in keys. For just those items in each key are scored.
Omega is not well defined for two factors, but for small sets of items, two is the better choice. For larger number of items per scale, 3 is probably preferable.
By default, find splitHalf reliabilities as well as the omega statistics. When plotting, split implies that raw was called in reliability.
By default, suppress the omega plots for each scale.
If TRUE, return a list of all the possible splits (up to n.samples).  Useful for graphic display. 
If TRUE then  split and raw are forced to TRUE and the histograms of the split half values are drawn.  (Otherwise, just return the values for later plotting)
Normally defaults to 10,000.  This means that for up to 16 item tests, all possible splits are found.  choose(n,n/2)/2 explodes above that, eg. for all splits of the epi E scale requires 1,352,078 splits or 23.4 seconds on a MacBook Pro with a 2.4GHZ 8 core Intel Core I9.

 if TRUE  find total scores, if FALSE (default), find average scores 
 a vector of item labels. 
missing = TRUE is the normal case and data are imputed according to the impute option.  missing=FALSE, only complete cases are scored.
impute="median" replaces missing values with the item medians, impute = "mean" replaces values with the mean response. impute="none" the subject's scores are based upon the average of the keyed, but non missing scores. impute = "none" is probably more appropriate for a large number of missing cases (e.g., SAPA data).  
if delete=TRUE, automatically delete items with no variance (and issue a warning)
May be specified as minimum item score allowed, else will be calculated from data.  min and max should be specified if items differ in their possible minima or maxima.  See notes for details.
May be specified as maximum item score allowed, else will be calculated from data.  Alternatively, in response frequencies, it is maximum number  of alternative responses to count.

If scoring from a correlation matrix, specify the number of subjects allows for the calculation of the confidence intervals for alpha.
By default, just find the statistics of those items that are included in scoring keys.  This allows scoring of data sets that have bad data for some items that are not included in the scoring keys. This also speeds up the scoring of small subsets of item from larger data sets.

This is just a matrix of weights to use for each item for each scale.
 Matrix or dataframe of raw item scores
if TRUE, then find weighted standard scores else just use raw data
By default, find the average item score. If sums = TRUE, then find the sum scores.  This is useful for regression with an intercept term
impute="median" replaces missing values with the item medians, impute = "mean" replaces values with the mean response. impute="none" the subject's scores are based upon the average of the keyed, but non missing scores. impute = "none" is probably more appropriate for a large number of missing cases (e.g., SAPA data).

If TRUE will automatically reverse items based upon their correlation with the first principal component.  Will throw a warning when doing so, but some people seem to miss this kind of message.
If TRUE, then warn when items are reverse scored
If TRUE, include the lmer variance decomposition. By default, this is true, but this can lead to long times for large data sets. 
If TRUE, the data are sorted by id and time.  This allows for random ordering of data, but will fail if ids are duplicated in different studies.  In that case, we need to add a constant to the ids for each study.  See the last example.
The input may be in one of four forms:

a) a data frame or matrix of dichotmous data (e.g., the lsat6 from the bock data set) or discrete numerical (i.e., not too many levels, e.g., the big 5 data set, bfi) for polychoric, or continuous for the case of biserial and polyserial. 

b) a 2 x 2 table of cell counts or cell frequencies (for tetrachoric) or an n x m table of cell counts  (for both tetrachoric and polychoric). 

c) a vector with elements corresponding to the four cell frequencies (for tetrachoric)

d) a vector with elements of the two marginal frequencies (row and column) and the comorbidity (for tetrachoric)
A (matrix or dataframe) of discrete scores. In the case of tetrachoric, these should be dichotomous, for polychoric not too many levels, for biserial they should be discrete (e.g., item responses) with not too many (&lt;10?) categories.
Correction value to use to correct for continuity in the case of zero entry cell for tetrachoric, polychoric, polybi, and mixed.cor.  See the examples for the effect of correcting versus not correcting for continuity.
if TRUE and if the tetrachoric/polychoric matrix is not positive definite, then apply a simple smoothing algorithm using cor.smooth
When finding pairwise correlations, should we use the global values of the tau parameter (which is somewhat faster), or the local values (global=FALSE)?  The local option is equivalent to the polycor solution, or to doing one correlation at a time. global=TRUE borrows information for one item pair from the other pairs using those item's frequencies.   This will make a difference in the presence of lots of missing data. With very small sample sizes with global=FALSE and correct=TRUE, the function will fail (for as yet underdetermined reasons. 
A no longer used option, kept to stop other packages from breaking.
A vector of length of the number of observations that specifies the weights to apply to each case.  The NULL case is equivalent of weights of 1 for all cases.

A square matrix 
An input matrix or data frame.  If x is not a correlation matrix, then the correlations are found.
If specified,  then a number of scales can be tested at once. (See <code>scoreItems</code> for a similar procedure.)
By default, find the Pearson correlation, other options are "spearman","kendall","tet"(for tetrachoric), "poly" (for polychoric), or  "mixed"
If using "tetrachoric" or "polychoric" correlations, should we correct empty cells for continuity, and if so, by how much.  (See <code>tetrachoric</code> for a discussion of this correction)

a constant to be added to the denominator of the relativeoffset convergence criterion calculation to avoid a zero divide in the casewhere the fit of a model to data is very close.
